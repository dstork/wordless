# TODO

* check if count_1w100k.txt can be used (license)
* ~~clean up old project files~~
* adapt readme.md
* ~~introduce new logic~~
	* ~~always show the most common word (how to handle the case where multiple have value 1?)~~
	* ~~user confirms the best word via a "USE" button (or ENTER automatically gets the best word and enters it in the next line)~~
	* ~~word is entered into the five individual fields automatically, user can set grey/yellow/green~~
* ~~Move "show me" button down~~
* "bad letters" should be like Wordle, UI-wise (individual letters, no word)
	* it should be editable -- now it's not possible to remove letters
* ~~Need to catch keyboard events also on "App", then fill the input fields based on the input~~
* create a user monkey script that allows solving them on the Wordle page itself
* ~~allow multiple inputs (6 tries, like in the original)~~
* generate a github page for the repo
* write tests, at least for buildRegex.js
* properly handle the case, where no word is found (due to wrong input e.g.)
